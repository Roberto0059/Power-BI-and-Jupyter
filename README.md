# Power-BI-and-Jupyter

<h2>Power BI and Jupyter Dataset Project</h2>

- My following data set pertains to TV shows and movies available on Netflix as of 2019.
The dataset contains the following data points: show_id title, director, cast, country, date_added,
release_year,rating, and duration, listed in, and description type. 

- In terms of goals for my analysis, I based it on rating distribution, monthly distribution, 
and regional analysis. Lastly, I used Jupyter, whichâ€™s integrated within Kaggle. I configured the 
dataset to display a comparison between the number of movies and TV shows that were added to 
Netflix throughout the year. Also displayed were the top 5 countries that had the most shows 
produced within their country. On the other hand, I used PowerBI to categorize the movies and 
shows within different countries. Also, I wanted to analyze the ratings of movies and shows 
within each country. Lastly, I went ahead and analyzed the shows in one season, as it was the 
most popular of all countries
